# Dylan's Dotfiles

These are configuration files I use across a variety of environments including two Windows desktops (running Ubuntu within Windows) and two Ubuntu laptops. Do I still use Mac OS sometimes?

## Check the Wiki

This repo is very messy right now! [Check the wiki](https://github.com/dylan-k/dotfiles/wiki) for notes on how I have Ubuntu configured with i3 window manager, and other configs for a lean, mean writing machine..
